# Screenshots UI tests

Matomo contains UI tests that compare captured screenshots of URLs and UI controls with expected screenshots.
If a captured screenshot does not match its expected screenshot, the build will fail. 

For a developer documentation, refer to the following guide: https://developer.matomo.org/guides/tests-ui
